This is for students completing their 10th and preparing for their JEE/SAT/BITSAT exams. I propose to conduct 12 sessions, 3 hours each after the 10th exams. In these 10 sessions, the emphasis will be on understanding the fundamentals. The batch size will be small. These sessions will be done before your regular classes/college start. This way, the students will find themselves way ahead of their peers and will be able to absorb much more from any classes. I will always be available at a later date to provide further guidance if required...


What will be taught --- Since an underlying understanding of core maths is essential for maths, physics or chemistry, I will be teaching core math concepts including calculus, trigonometry, co-ordinate geometry, and statistics. Some of these help them understand Physics as well. I provide an approach to analyse problems with a different perspective. While this will not be a textbook based approach, it will help the student to think independently and differently. The way I structure the material, it will not really matter if the student has completed 9th or 10th. A few of my students can give testimonials as how they learnt the whole 11th-12th Calculus in about 10 hours.
