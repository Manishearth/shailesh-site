This is for students completing their 10<sup>th</sup> and preparing for their JEE/SAT/BITSAT exams. I propose to conduct 12 sessions, 3 hours each after the 10<sup>th</sup> exams. In these 10 sessions, the emphasis will be on understanding the fundamentals. The batch size will be small. These sessions will be done before your regular classes/college start. This way, the students will find themselves way ahead of their peers and will be able to absorb much more from any classes. I will always be available at a later date to provide further guidance if required...


What will be taught --- Since an underlying understanding of core maths is essential for maths, physics or chemistry, I will be teaching core math concepts including calculus, trigonometry, co-ordinate geometry, and statistics. Some of these help them understand Physics as well. I provide an approach to analyse problems with a different perspective. While this will not be a textbook based approach, it will help the student to think independently and differently. The way I structure the material, it will not really matter if the student has completed 9<sup>th</sup> or 10<sup>th</sup>. A few of my students can give testimonials as how they learnt the whole 11<sup>th</sup>-12<sup>th</sup> Calculus in about 10 hours.
