I studied the basics of the Fundamental Theory of Calculus and other advanced concepts of Mathematics under Shailesh. Even though I was doing work ahead of my grade level and barking up trees that had yet been unexplored in my school, Shailesh, with his unique teaching methods made the learning fun and fast. His unique way of teaching which involves drilling the concepts rather than the problems works wonders when it comes to the abstruse art of Calculus and he has truly mastered the teaching of this art. Hands down, he is one of the best Mathematics teachers available.
