                    <p>Whether the child is going to some tuitions or classes year round, the child is burdened with solving a certain number of problems â€“ many times mechanically, and the real understanding for the subject is not there. Also most of the times these classes have no time to inculcate a love for the subject. They expect their students to already be at a certain level of understanding and right from the first week, students are forced into a rut of HW, practice tests, tutorials etc. This results in the student doing the chores in a routine way, not getting any free time, and not making significant progress in the subject either. For science students, transition into college maths after school maths is a huge leap. In college, the complexity of maths increases manifold. Students who are extremely comfortable in maths at school struggle to adjust to it in college. Further this struggle gets out of control when they are preparing for competitive exams like JEE, BITSAT, SAT etc.

<p>Maths is not as difficult as it is known to be. It is a very beautiful and interesting subject provided you learn it correctly. If one learns fundamentals well then one will start enjoying maths. The tuition classes often do not have time and inclination for all this</p>
